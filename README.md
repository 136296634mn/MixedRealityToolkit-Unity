# What is MixedRealityToolkit

MRTK is a Microsoft Driven open source project. 

MRTK-Unity provides a set of foundational components and features to accelerate MR app development in Unity. Latest Release of MRTK (V2) supports HoloLens/HoloLens 2, WMR, and OpenVR platform.

# What's MRTK-Unity good for 
 
* Provide basic features as an easy to use SDK to reduce the barrier-to-entry to get started.

* Enable rapid prototyping by providing the basic building blocks for MR app development. 

* Showcase best practices in MR with UI controls and interactions that matches the WMR and HoloLens Shell. 

* Support a wide audience, allowing solutions to be built that will run on multiple VR / AR / XR platforms such as Mixed Reality,  Steam/Open VR.

* Ensure an extensive framework for advanced integrators, with the ability to swap out core components with their own should they wish to, or simply extend the framework to add new capabilities.

# Getting Started with MRTK 

You can find out how to use MRTK to develop for Windows Mixed Reality on the MS Developer Site.

The Mixed Reality team have prepared a few guides for getting up to speed on using the new Mixed Reality Toolkit, which can be found here:

* [Downloading the Mixed Reality Toolkit](/Documentation/DownloadingTheMRTK.md)
* [Getting Started with the Mixed Reality Toolkit](/Documentation/GettingStartedWithTheMRTK.md)
* [Mixed Reality Toolkit configuration guide](/Documentation/MixedRealityConfigurationGuide.md)

Find this readme, other documentation articles and the MRTK api reference on our [MRTK Dev Portal on github.io](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/).

# Examples and QuickStart scenes

One radical change to the Mixed Reality Toolkit vNext, will be the standards and approaches to real world example scenes.

New examples will follow strict guidelines, such as:

* Each example must have a use and demonstrate a real world test case (no tests).
* Each example will use a standardized template, so all examples have the same look and feel.
* Each sample will be fully documented, detailing both the use case it is demonstrating and how to implement the features demonstrated.

> Check the "Work In Progress" section of the [Windows Mixed Reality - vNext SDK](MRTK-SDK.md) for a peek at the first new example.
