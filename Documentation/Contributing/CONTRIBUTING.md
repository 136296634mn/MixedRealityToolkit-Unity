# Contributing

The Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) welcomes contributions from the community. Whether it is for a minor change like fixing typos and small bug fixes, or a new feature or component.

For larger submissions, please refer to the [feature contribution guidelines / process](Feature_Contribution_Process.md) to ensure a smooth process and a good quality of code and documentation.

All changes be they small or large, need to adhere to the [MRTK coding standards](CodingGuidelines.md), so please ensure you are familiar with these while developing to avoid delays when the change is being reviewed.

If you have any questions, please reach out on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mrtk) or the [HoloDevelopers slack](https://holodevelopers.slack.com/). You can join the Slack community via the [automatic invitation sender](https://holodevelopersslack.azurewebsites.net/).

# Submission process
We provide several paths to enable developers to contribute to the Mixed Reality Toolkit, all starting with [creating a new Issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/issues/new/choose)

![Select Issue Type](../Images/Contributing/SelectIssueType.png)

From here you file:

- **Bug report** - Functionality issue with one of the Mixed Reality Toolkit components
- **Documentation issue** - Issue with the Mixed Reality Toolkit [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)
- **Feature request** - Proposal for a new Mixed Reality Toolkit feature

# Proposing Feature Requests

When requesting a new Mixed Reality Toolkit feature, you should document the customer benefit / problem to be solved.

This documentation can be as simple as a few sentences describing the problem and solution, or it can be a formal design specification.

Once submitted, your feature request will be reviewed and discussed on GitHub. We encourage open and constructive discussion of each feature proposal to ensure that the work is beneficial to a large segment of customers.

To avoid needing to rework the feature, it is generally recommended that development of the feature does not begin during the review phase. Many times, the community review process uncovers one or more issues that may require significant changes in the proposed implementation.

Please review the [Feature Contribution Process](Feature_Contribution_Process.md) for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to work on something that already exists on our backlog, you can use that work item as your proposal. Be sure to also comment on the task notifying maintainers that you're working towards completing it.
