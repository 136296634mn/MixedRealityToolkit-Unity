# Eye Tracking Examples in MRTK
This page covers how to get quickly started with using Eye Tracking in MRTK by building on our provided MRTK example package.
The samples let you experience one of our new magical input capabilities: **Eye Tracking**! 
The demo include a number of different use cases for seamlessly combining information about what you are looking at with **Voice** and **Hand** input. 
This enables users to quickly and effortlessly select and move holograms across their view simply by looking at a target and saying _'Select'_ or performing a hand gesture. 
The demos also include an example for eye-gaze-directed scroll, pan and zoom of text and images on a slate. 
Finally, an example is provided for recording and visualizing the user's visual attention on a 2D slate.


## Overview of our Eye Tracking Input Tutorials

[**Eye-Supported Target Selection**](/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_TargetSelection.md)

This tutorial showcases the ease of accessing eye gaze data to select targets. 
It includes an example for subtle yet powerful feedback to provide confidence to the user that a target is focused while not being overwhelming.
In addition, we showcase a simple example of smart notifications that automatically disappear after being read. 

**Summary**: Fast and effortless target selections using a combination of Eyes, Voice and Hand input.

[**Eye-Supported Navigation**](/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_Navigation.md)

Imagine you are reading some information on a distant display or your e-reader and when you reach the end of the displayed text, the text automatically scrolls up to reveal more content. 
Or how about magically zooming directly toward where you were looking at? 
These are some of the examples showcased in this tutorial about eye-supported navigation.
In addition, we added an example for hands-free rotation of 3D holograms by making them automatically rotate based on your current focus. 

**Summary**: Scroll, Pan, Zoom, 3D Rotation using a combination of Eyes, Voice and Hand input.

[**Eye-Supported Positioning**](/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_Positioning.md)

In this tutorial, we showcase a popular input scenario called “Put that there” based on research work from Bolt in the early 1980s. 
The idea is simple: Benefit from your eyes for fast target selection and positioning. 
If refinement is required, use additional input from your hands, voice or controllers. 

**Summary**: Positioning holograms using Eyes+Voice & Eyes+Hands (*drag-and-drop*). Eye-supported sliders using Eyes+Hands.

[**Visualization of Visual Attention**](/Documentation/EyeTracking/EyeTracking_Visualization.md)

Information about where users looked at is an immensely powerful tool to assess work streams and improve search patterns. 
In this tutorial, we discuss different eye tracking visualizations and how they fit different needs. 
We provide you with examples for logging and loading eye tracking data and examples for how to visualize them. 

**Summary**: Two-dimensional attention map (heatmaps) on slates. Recording & Replaying Eye Tracking data.
