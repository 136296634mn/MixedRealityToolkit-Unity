# Eye Tracking in the Mixed Reality Toolkit

'HoloLens 2' offers an exciting and powerful new input: Eye tracking!
Eye tracking enables users to quickly and effortlessly engage with holograms across their view and can make your system smarter by better identifying a user's intention.

New to Eye Tracking? No problem! We have created a number of videos, tutorials and samples to get you started in the [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) (MRTK)! We recommend starting by exploring some of the existing eye tracking samples that demonstrate best practices for eye-based interactions. You can then use these samples to pull the parts that seem relevant to you in your app. Finally, we also describe how to set up an fresh scene with the core components to get eye tracking working in your app.
