# What is MixedRealityToolkit.Staging

The MixedRealityToolkit.Staging folder in the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit contains a collection of components that are in active development and
may provide benefit for some customers. It has been created to allow the delivery of these features to customers while
the MRTK team works to implement packaging changes that may have posed risk to the product.

> [!Important]
> This folder is expected to be removed from the **_next_** version of the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit. Please take no dependencies on the current structure.
